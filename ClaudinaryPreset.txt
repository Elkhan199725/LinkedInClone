✅ Cloudinary Presets — FINAL AGREED SETUP (SUMMARY)

We decided to use frontend-only uploads with Cloudinary unsigned presets.
The backend never handles files, it only stores the returned URLs.

🧠 Important Rules We Agreed On
1️⃣ No endpoints configured in Cloudinary UI

Presets = rules only

Endpoints are chosen later in frontend code

Nothing about endpoints is written in Cloudinary

2️⃣ If file format is wrong

Cloudinary rejects the upload

File is not stored

No backend impact

Frontend receives error

3️⃣ Security model

Frontend uploads directly to Cloudinary

Backend only accepts URLs from your Cloudinary domain

No API secrets in frontend

Unsigned presets only

4️⃣ Free plan is fine

Unlimited presets

Costs only depend on storage/bandwidth

Images + small videos are safe on free tier

🔜 When we do frontend (later)

We will:

Use one upload function per type

Pick preset based on file type

Store returned secure_url in backend:

UserProfile.ProfilePhotoUrl

PostMedia.Url

UserDocument.Url

No backend refactor needed.

When you come back and say something like

“Let’s wire Cloudinary presets into React frontend”

I’ll pick up exactly from here, using these preset names and rules.
