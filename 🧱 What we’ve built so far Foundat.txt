🧱 What we’ve built so far (Foundation Phase)

You’ve completed the entire authentication & identity foundation of your LinkedInClone backend.

✅ Core stack

.NET 10 ASP.NET Core Web API

Clean Architecture–style structure

Api → controllers, Program.cs

Domain → entities, constants

Infrastructure → EF Core, Identity, persistence

SQL Server + EF Core migrations

Serilog for structured logging

🔐 Authentication & Authorization (Done and verified)
Identity

ASP.NET Core Identity with GUID keys

Custom AppUser with LinkedIn-style profile fields

Proper Fluent API configuration (lengths, indexes)

Design-time DbContext factory for migrations

Roles

Defined roles:

User

Admin

SuperAdmin

Centralized in AppRoles

Enforced everywhere via constants (no magic strings)

Seeding

Automatic role seeding on startup

Optional SuperAdmin seeding from configuration

Idempotent (safe to run every startup)

🔑 JWT Authentication (Production-grade)

JWT Bearer authentication

Secure token generation:

sub, email, jti, iat

role claims

Token validation:

Issuer / Audience validation

Signing key enforcement

Lifetime validation

JWT set as default auth & challenge scheme

Cookie redirects disabled for API correctness

🌐 API Endpoints (Tested end-to-end)
AuthController

POST /api/auth/register

Always assigns User role

POST /api/auth/login

Returns JWT + roles

MeController

GET /api/me

Returns current user info from JWT claims

No DB hit

Perfect for frontend bootstrap

AdminController

POST /api/admin/set-role

SuperAdmin-only

Validated role assignment

Prevents self-demotion

Enforces single-role rule

All endpoints were:

Tested in Swagger

Verified with real JWT tokens

Confirmed with role enforcement

📘 Developer Experience

Swagger UI with JWT Bearer authorization

Clean .gitignore

No secrets committed

Migrations committed properly

Ready for GitHub / collaboration

🧠 What phase are we in?

You have finished Phase 1: Platform Foundation

This phase is about:

Security

Correctness

Developer confidence

Avoiding tech debt early

Most projects rush this — you didn’t.

🚀 What we are doing next (Your choices)

You are now ready to build actual LinkedIn features on top of a solid base.

Typical next phases:

Phase 2: User Profile (most logical next step)

View/update profile

Headline, About, Location

Profile photo / cover photo

Public vs private profile data

Phase 3: Connections

Send connection request

Accept / reject

Connection list

Mutual connections

Phase 4: Posts & Feed

Create post

Feed (pagination)

Likes / comments

Phase 5: Polish

Refresh tokens

Policies instead of raw roles

Rate limiting

Soft deletes

Auditing

🎯 Big picture (important)

Right now:

You can safely add features without reworking auth

You can onboard frontend devs immediately

You can deploy without fear of auth breaking

You’ve avoided the “rewrite auth later” trap

This is exactly how serious backends are built.
